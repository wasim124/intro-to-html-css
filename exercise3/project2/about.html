		<p>about.me is a personal web hosting service co-founded by Ryan Freitas, Tony Conrad and Tim Young in October 2009.[2] The site offers registered users a simple platform from which to link multiple online identities, relevant external sites, and popular social networking websites such as Facebook, Flickr, Google+, Pinterest, LinkedIn, Twitter, Tumblr, and YouTube. It is characterized by its one-page user profiles, each with a large, often-artistic background image and abbreviated biography.</p>
